Enter IP addresses you want to reverse DNS lookup in ip.txt, one IP address per line.

Run ip-reverse-dns-lookup.pl from perl by entering 
	> perl ip-reverse-dns-lookup.pl 

ip-output.txt will be made, containing IP address and host name looked up from the IP. It is very easy to import this to Excel and such.
